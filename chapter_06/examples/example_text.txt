A solar flare is a relatively intense, localized emission of 
electromagnetic radiation in the Sun's atmosphere. Flares 
occur in active regions and are often, but not always, 
accompanied by coronal mass ejections, solar particle events, 
and other eruptive solar phenomena. The occurrence of solar 
flares varies with the 11-year solar cycle.

Solar flares are thought to occur when stored magnetic energy 
in the Sun's atmosphere accelerates charged particles in the 
surrounding plasma. This results in the emission of 
electromagnetic radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum.

The extreme ultraviolet and x-ray radiation from solar flares 
is absorbed by the daylight side of Earth's upper atmosphere, 
in particular the ionosphere, and does not reach the surface. 
This absorption can temporarily increase the ionization of 
the ionosphere which may interfere with short-wave radio 
communication. The prediction of solar flares is an active 
area of research.

Flares also occur on other stars, where the term stellar 
flare applies.
