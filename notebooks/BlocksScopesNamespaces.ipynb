    "We wanted to execute two statements when a condition is true and 2 different statements when it is false. Note how the statements are grouped together using the braces. Although frequently C++ programmers use indentation to make such groupings easy to see, the **indentation has no syntactic meaning** in C++. The start and end of blocks is marked by `{` and `}` alone. Blocks can be created inside other blocks. But blocks may not overlap partially. The usual rules of opening and closing of nested parentheses apply. \n",
