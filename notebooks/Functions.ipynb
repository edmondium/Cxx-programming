    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "As the last topic for this notebook on fundamental concepts, let's examine functions. Unlike what we have been doing in this interpreted environment, all executable code like, `1 + 1`, `std::cout << whatever`, `for` loops, `if` statements ... all such code must be inside functions in C++. Only declarations of global variables, class and function definitions and other similar things can occur outside function bodies. In fact, function definitions **can not be inside bodies of other functions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are recipes for calculating zero or more outputs from zero or more inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "auto func_name(double x) -> double\n",
    "{\n",
    "    if (x > 1.0 or x < -1.0) \n",
    "        return 0;\n",
    "    else \n",
    "        return (1 - x) * (1 - x);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Any conceptually important input->output mapping can be made into a function. The top line in the function definition above, called its header, makes the input->output connections clear. Function inputs go in the parentheses `()`, and the output is written to the right of the input: `(inputs) -> output`. The older function syntax, shared with \"C\" is written as follows:\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "double func_name(double x)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // recipe\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is still valid, and in this notebook it is the only working syntax for functions. But I consider the newer syntax with output to the right clearer and preferable. Outside this notebook, that syntax should be favoured.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Side effects\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions may also have side effects on the global state of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "auto largest_squared_num = 0.;\n",
    "auto sqr(double x) -> double\n",
    "{\n",
    "    x = x * x;\n",
    "    if (x > largest_squared_num)\n",
    "        largest_squared_num = x;\n",
    "    return x;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time we call the above function, there is a chance that we modify the global variable `largest_squared_num`. We can always look at the variable `largest_squared_num` to see the largest square calculated in the program so far. That value is not the \"result\" of the function, but it may change when we call `sqr`. That is called a side-effect. Any time you write something with `std::cout`, it is a side effect, because it changes the state of the global IO buffers. Side effects are sometimes necessary, or else we will not be able to write anything on the screen or in a file. Functions without any side-effects, strictly calculating an output from some inputs, are called \"pure\" functions. `func_name` above is a pure function. `sqr` above is not. Pure functions can be called simultaneously from any number of threads, and we can be confident that each of the calls will produce the right answer. If a function modifies global state, those modifications must be carefully orchestrated so that, multiple threads do not simultaneously modify a global variable, which can lead to incorrect or invalid states for those global variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using global constants does not modify global state, and hence does not have side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function is not meant to calculate and return any answer, its return type is written as `void`. Since `auto func(int i) -> void` looks somewhat awkward, we use the older syntax `void fun(int i)` for those functions. It helps distinguishing those \"procedures\" from other functions. A `void` returning function which is also pure, is simply some extra text. (no effects, no side-effects)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the formal parameter is an L-value reference, the function may change the value of the object used to initialize it. This is another kind of side effect. L-value reference parameters to a function can be considered **out**-parameters, or **in-out**-parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable visibility\n",
    "\n",
    "The function bodies define a top level block scope. The only variables known in a function are\n",
    "\n",
    "    - those which are declared in the function\n",
    "    - input parameters\n",
    "    - global (namespace) scope variables\n",
    "    \n",
    "In particular, variables in the bodies of other functions are not available for use. The scoping rules, different control flow mechanisms you have learned so far can be used to write the recipe to calculate output values from inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's practice that!"

    "We didn't have to invent different names like `power_double_int` and `power_double_double` for these functions. This is because that is conceptually what the compiler is doing for us! To the C++ compiler, the name of a function is not just the name by which you see it, but it is that name + the types of all the inputs to the function. Therefore, as far as the compiler is concerned, we declared two completely different functions above. How does the compiler know which one to invoke when we write an expression like `power(a, b)` ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even at the call site, if `a` is a double and `b` is an integer, the compiler sees it as an attempt to call `power_double_int`. The existence of the other function does not matter. If `b` is a double, it is again, clear to the compiler! You want to call `power_double_double`, and the compiler knows what that is!\n",

    "The function overloading mechanism is a purely compile time process. In any C++ program, the compiler resolves the entire possible set of function calls ahead of time (Let's discuss *virtual* function calls in due time along with C++ classes). This decision, whether to call one or the other version of `power` is not happening at program execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that the compiler is able to distinguish between the overloads. You can not have two versions of `power` each taking a `double` and `int`, but one handling positive integers and the other handling negative integrs. You might think that `double` and `int` are, of course, easy to tell apart. How similar can the type of the second input parameter be and still be used to overload `power` ?"

Recursive functions can sometimes be used to express complex tasks, such as tree processing, elegantly and compactly.

I refer you to the section 2.2.4.1 (\"Whiteboard stack\") for a more extended discussion. Right now, let's just rig our factorial function so that we can see this: "

The fields of a tuple are simply \"first field\", \"second field\" ... They have no names. The implementer of the function can not indicate their intent about which field is what.
