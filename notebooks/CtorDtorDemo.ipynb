    "Objects of `struct` types can be initialized using the `{` `}` initializer syntax specifying the components. However, in some situations, we may want different non-trivial kinds of initialization. Any kind of initialization can be performed for a class with any number of desired inputs. The initialization functions are called \"Constructors\" and they have the same name as the class. Every time an object comes into existence, it is implicitly or explicitly a call to one of these initialization functions or constructors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, every time an object runs out of scope and is to be removed from the program, a different \"destructor\" function is **automatically** called. Constructors are typically overloaded: there are many ways to create an object. The destructor for a class is unique."
