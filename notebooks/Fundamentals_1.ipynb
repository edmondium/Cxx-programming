    "# Getting started with C++ using Jupyter notebook: Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will guide you through the initial steps for an introduction to C++. \n",
    "Usually, C++ programs have to be \"compiled\" and then the compiled programs can be executed. For educational purposes, the instant feedback one gets in *interpreted* languages like Python is often considered \"easier\". There have been a few attempts to create interpreters for C++, which execute C++ programs line by line without having to compile it first. Cling is such an interpreter. There are Jupyter notebook kernels using the cling interpreter, and we are going to use one of them occasionally in this course, when it fits the purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some caveats though:\n",
    "\n",
    "- C++ is a compiled language. To make it work in an intrepreter, additional rules are required, which are outside standard C++ language rules. Learning to structure C++ programs to suit the interpreter will impose an unnatural organisation, outside what is considered best practice in the developer community.\n",
    "- cling is currently version 0.9. It works for some straight forward code in C++, but it's C++ coverage is NOT EVEN VAGUELY complete. A failure of cling to understand a piece of code does not necessarily mean the syntax is incorrect. Reason with what you know about C++. Use the real clang compiler or a different interpreter based on the latest compiler (see next point!). And while in this course, ask me!\n",
    "- For this course, an alias \"cppint\" is available in a terminal, which mimics a python like shell, but parses C++ code using the compiler in the PATH. It is a slightly modified version of REPLE (https://github.com/BenBrock/reple.git).\n",
    "- The Cling version on JupyterHub JSC is based on LLVM version 9.0, and the current LLVM version is 16.0. Many newer language features are simply unknown to the current version of cling. In particular, C++20 features. Because C++20 is by and large backwards compatible with C++17, we can use this notebook to learn about a subset of features.\n",
    "- It is necessary to restart cling based Jupyter kernels often. Quite often it is because of inadequate language support. For instance, standard input does not work in Jupyter-cling, i.e., the C++ code can not ask the user for input and then process what the user types. Such things are trivial in normal C++, but not inside this notebook. We will skip anything that needs standard input in our notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "All that said, to test a single line of code, this interpreter provides a very practical shortcut over writing a full program and going through the write - compile - run cycle. While learning, we need a lot of really small programs, and we will use this Jupyter notebook with xeus-cling kernel to illustrate syntax when possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each \"cell\" in this notebook contains either some text I wrote or a little bit of code. To \"execute\" a cell, you press Shift+Enter on your keyboard. Use the Help menu above to find out about keyboard shortcuts for Jupyter notebook. This first exercise session of the course is mostly intended as \"self study\" with the help of this notebook. Insert new cells using the insert menu above. Either type some code to test something in the new cells, or make it into a \"markdown\" cell by typing Esc+m. You can then type your own notes along side the material given. Ask if you need anything explained!\n"

If you say it is a 32-bit floating point number (decimal number), the exact same bits represent the number **3.1415927**. It's not possible to tell what kind of value is stored in a block of memory by staring hard at the bits. The programming language associates \"types\" with stored (and literal) values, which define the number of bits in a value of that type and the rules governing the interpretation of those bits (among other things).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few types built into the C++ language, called imaginatively, \"built-in types\". These are,\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `int`, `unsigned int` : (typically) 32-bit signed and unsigned integers\n",
    "    - `long`, `unsigned long` : (typically) 64-bit signed and unsigned integers\n",
    "    - `short`, `unsigned short`: (typically) 16-bit signed and unsigned integers\n",
    "    - `char`, `unsigned char`: 8-bit signed and unsigned integers, interpreted as characters\n",
    "    - `float` : 32-bit floating point numbers (no \"unsigned float\"!)\n",
    "    - `double` : 64-bit floating point numbers (no \"unsigned double\"!)\n",
    "    - `bool` : A type storing true or false\n",
    "    \n",
    "Besides these built-in types, C++ provides mechanisms for programmers to create new data types whose behaviour (what operations make sense on that type, what happens when you add, subtract etc. etc.) is programmable. User defined data types are created using C++ **class**es (or **struct**s), which will be discussed in detail later in the course. The C++ standard library introduces a lot of very useful classes. These are written using the *same mechanisms* as those which are available to you to create your classes. The standard library classes are, by and large, user defined types, and will be called so in the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important takeaway from all this is that in order to know how to make meaningful calculations with a sequence of bits, the computer needs to know what type we associate with those bits. In other words, to interpret a \"value\" from a sequence of bits, the bit representation must be combined with type information. An \"object\" is a concrete example of a sequence of bits representing a value of a certain type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like lots of programming languages, you can create \"named\" objects, or  *variables*, to store and reuse values.  *variables* are convenient stores of useful values so that we can use them in subsequent work, change the stored values etc. If you ever owned an old fashioned calculator, where you could memorize some calculated values and restore them later, that's roughly the role of a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declarations\n",
    "Here is how you create variables in C++:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "auto x = 1;  // create an integer variable\n",
    "auto y = 1.0; // create a double variable\n",
    "auto z = 2U; // create an unsigned integer variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable stores a value. If you have a value you want to store, assign it to a name of your choosing with the `auto` keyword before it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of the `=` sign above, we could braces `{` and `}` to set th initial values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "auto x{1};  // create an integer variable\n",
    "auto y{1.0}; // create a double variable\n",
    "auto z{2U}; // create an unsigned integer variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another alternative syntax for declarations is as follows. In these declarations, we explicitly tell the type of the values we want:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "int x = 1;\n",
    "double y = 1.0;\n",
    "unsigned int z = 1U;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or using braces:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "int x{1};\n",
    "double y{1.0};\n",
    "unsigned int z{1U};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When using braces with explicit type specification above, the compiler can apply some additional checks. For instance, in `int x{1}`, we have told the \n",
    "compiler that we are trying to create an integer. If we then try to initialize it with `1.4`, it will report it as an error. `int x = 1.4`, on the other hand,\n",
    "will be accepted silently, converting the `1.4` in to the specified type, `int`. We will have a variable of `int` type with a value `1`. If we wrote `int i{1.4}`,\n",
    "it is not a very sane thing to do. There are some possibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - we wanted to write double, but wrote int by mistake\n",
    "    - we wanted to write 14 but typed an extra dot at the wrong place\n",
    "    - other equally weird scenarios, none of them is \"exactly what we want\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "It is useful if the compiler gives us an error in such situations. The brace `{`, `}` syntax for initialisation is therefore somewhat more restrictive, and\n",
    "should be preferred. It also allows us to set variables to their default initial values:\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "unsigned long counter{};\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above, we create an unsigned long integer type with its default initial value, $0$. Since we are telling the type directly, this can work, whereas `auto counter{}` would be meaningless, as `auto` infers the type from the initialiser expression. When using explicit typenames to declare a variable, we can completely skip the initial value, e.g., `double x;`. `x` is then created uninitialised. There are special cases where even such an expression will lead to `x` being nicely zero initialised, but it is much better to always initialise with a literal value or with the default value explicitly. It is not recommended to leave the initializer out for built in types. For user defined types, C++ offers so much control that the creater of that user defined type gets to decide whether `UserdefinedType X` should create `X` uninitialised, zero initialised or initialised to any other sensible value."

You will see that `v` becomes an `int` after the last line above, whereas it starts out being a `str`. Such a thing will never be allowed in C++. The type of an entity is set when you declare it. It can not be changed by assignment. Allowing that would make reasoning about properties of a variable extremely hard: the type of a variable in one given line of code might end up depending on the code path taken to reach a particular line.

If is an integer, 123, it will become 246. We have to consider the immediate history of the variable to know what will actually happen in the line `v = v + v`. Statically typed languages avoid this entire category of problems by making types of variables constants. In any C++ code, a variable which starts out as an object of type T will end its life as an object of type T.\n"

Both operators can be placed before or after the variable name for built in numeric types, `int`, `long`, `short`, `char` (and unsigned counterparts), `double`, `float` and `long double`. For user defined types, the meaning of the operator is decided by the implementor of that type. In all cases, there is a slight difference in the meaning between the prefix (e.g., `++i`) and postfix (e.g., `i++`) forms.

After we have evaluated `2 * x`, `x` is still `1`. But, `x = 4` is also an expression. Its value is the value of `x` after the assignment, i.e., `4`. But it also has a side effect. Whatever `x` was before, it has now changed to a value of `4`. Prefix and postfix `++` (or `--`) operators have the same side effect. They both increase a variable by 1.
