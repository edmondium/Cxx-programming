You know that a balanced coin toss should have 50-50 chance for heads and tails. If you do the experiment 10 times, do you *always* get 5 heads and 5 tails ? No. You might get 7-3 result once, 2-8 another time 5-5 another and so on. As the number of experiments becomes very very large, your results approach the theoretical values more and more. We performed one set of experiments above. Repeating it again will give us another set of frequencies. The larger the sample count, the more our observed frequenies resemble the theoretical expectations. Try generating $1000000$ samples instead of $1000$ and see if the numbers are closer!"
