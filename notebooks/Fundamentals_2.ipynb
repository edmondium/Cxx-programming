For instance, if you make `inp` into \"Frog\", there is no way to construct a `double` value out of the start of that string. The function `std::stod` then throws an exception. Once an exception is in flight, the program execution does not go line by line. It looks for the nearest enclosing `try` block. In this case, that's our `try` block. Program control looks for a `catch` block following that try block to see if the type of exception matches what is caught in the `catch` block. If it does, the code in that catch block is executed, and normal line-by-line execution begins from the `catch` block.
